### git push ** is used to push local commits to the master branch of the remote repository. Here is the basic structure of the code:

 git branch -d <branch-name>
 Example: Git <branch-Git.data>
 

- ###  git pull merges all changes that have been made in the local repository with the local working directory.

git pull

- ** git merge ** is used to merge a branch with another active branch:

- ** git diff ** is used to make a list of conflicts. In order to see conflicts regarding the base file, use:

git diff --base <homework.md>
